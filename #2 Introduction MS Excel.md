# Cell References 

A cell is an intersection between a row and a column. in a spreadsheet, values are stored in a cell.

Cell references is like an address for a cell. if a cell falls under column A and row 10, the reference for that cell is A10.

# Relative references

All the references we have used so far are Relative references.
Relative refrences changes when the formula is copied to another cell.

# Absolute references.

This reference does not change when the formula is moved across cells.

Sample - $A$1

When $ sign is put before a column header or row number. it lock that specific rows and column. when this refrence is moved to othes . $A$1 does not automactically changes.

This is useful in many cases - for eg. All values in a row/column

# Mixed References

As the name suggests, these are references in which one part is absolute and the ither part is relative..

Example 

A$2 - A = dynamic part $2 = fixed 2nd rows
$B2
